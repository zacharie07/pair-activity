BATEMAN: You like Huey Lewis and the News?

ALLEN: Um, they're okay.

BATEMAN: Their early work was a little too new wave for my 
taste. But when Sports came out in '83, I think they really 
came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole 
album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate 
professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's 
been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far 
more bitter, cynical sense of humor.

ALLEN: Hey, Halberstram?

BATEMAN: Yes, Allen?

ALLEN: Why are there copies of the Style section all over the 
place? Do you... Do you have a dog? A little chow or something?

BATEMAN: No, Allen.

ALLEN: Is that a raincoat?

BATEMAN: Yes, it is. In '87, Huey released this; Fore!, 
their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed 
masterpiece is "Hip To Be Square". A song so catchy, most 
people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, 
because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and 
the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement 
about the band itself. Hey, Paul!
